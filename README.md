1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.
2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their
differences and advantages.
3. Explain the terms "base class" and "derived class" in the context of inheritance.
4. What is the significance of the "protected" access modifier in inheritance? How does
it differ from "private" and "public" modifiers?
5. What is the purpose of the "super" keyword in inheritance? Provide an example.
6. Create a base class called "Vehicle" with attributes like "make", "model", and "year".
Then, create a derived class called "Car" that inherits from "Vehicle" and adds an
attribute called "fuel_type". Implement appropriate methods in both classes.
7. Create a base class called "Employee" with attributes like "name" and "salary."
Derive two classes, "Manager" and "Developer," from "Employee." Add an additional
attribute called "department" for the "Manager" class and "programming_language"
for the "Developer" class.
8. Design a base class called "Shape" with attributes like "colour" and "border_width."
Create derived classes, "Rectangle" and "Circle," that inherit from "Shape" and add
specific attributes like "length" and "width" for the "Rectangle" class and "radius" for
the "Circle" class.
9. Create a base class called "Device" with attributes like "brand" and "model." Derive
two classes, "Phone" and "Tablet," from "Device." Add specific attributes like
"screen_size" for the "Phone" class and "battery_capacity" for the "Tablet" class.
10. Create a base class called "BankAccount" with attributes like "account_number" and
"balance." Derive two classes, "SavingsAccount" and "CheckingAccount," from
"BankAccount." Add specific methods like "calculate_interest" for the
"SavingsAccount" class and "deduct_fees" for the "CheckingAccount" class.
